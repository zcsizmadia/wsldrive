# wsldrive

[![CI](https://github.com/zcsizmadia/wsldrive/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/zcsizmadia/wsldrive/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

**Cross the WSL2 filesystem boundary at native speed — in both directions.**

Anyone doing real work in WSL2 hits the same wall: files on the *other* side of the VM boundary are
slow. Opening a WSL source tree from Visual Studio or Explorer crawls over `\\wsl.localhost`; a Linux
build reading `/mnt/c` stalls on every file. It's the single most common WSL2 complaint, and it taxes
every edit-build-test loop that spans the two worlds.

`wsldrive` makes that boundary disappear. It keeps the whole directory tree's metadata in RAM on the
side that's reading, caches file contents, and moves bytes over a **Hyper-V socket** instead of the OS's
network filesystem — so cross-boundary access runs **5–15× faster on reads** (more on metadata) than the
paths Windows and WSL ship:

|   | today (OS path) | with wsldrive | speedup |
|---|--:|--:|--:|
| **Windows reading WSL files** (read 3000 files) | 2856 ms (`\\wsl.localhost`) | 366 ms | **~8×** |
| **WSL reading Windows files** (read 3000 files) | 5853 ms (`/mnt/c`) | 383 ms | **~15×** |
| directory walk, either direction | 100–400 ms | ~12–39 ms | **~3–30×** |

Both directions are read-write and mount *alongside* the built-in paths — nothing to replace, no kernel
driver of its own (WinFsp on Windows, libfuse3 in WSL). Full numbers in [`bench/RESULTS.md`](bench/RESULTS.md).

- **Direction A — WSL2 ext4 as a Windows drive letter.** Windows-only tools (Visual Studio, GitHub
  Desktop, Explorer/Search, Unity, Office) reach a WSL source tree without paying the `\\wsl.localhost`
  Plan 9 tax.
- **Direction B — a Windows drive mounted inside WSL2.** Linux tools read/write an NTFS tree without the
  `/mnt/c` 9P/virtiofs tax.

WSL2 only. WSL1 has no VM boundary (DrvFs runs in the NT kernel, `\\wsl$` is served in-process), so it
has neither problem and is unsupported by design.

## Install

The installer confirms each choice with you first, then does *everything else itself* — installs the
binaries, checks for / chain-installs WinFsp, creates an at-logon task that mounts on every boot, and
tears it all down cleanly on uninstall. The only thing you supply is what to mount where.

**Two modes:**

- **Easy (default) — Direction A only.** Mounts a WSL folder as a Windows drive letter over loopback TCP.
  No elevation for the mount, no registry changes, no WSL restart; the drive is visible to your normal
  apps and comes back on every reboot. This is the common case and the biggest WSL2 pain.
- **Advanced — Direction A *and* B, side by side.** Adds a Windows folder mounted *inside* WSL
  (a Linux path, not a drive letter). Direction B uses the Hyper-V socket transport, which needs a
  one-time elevated registration and a single `wsl --shutdown` — the installer does both.

### 1. Download the installer (easiest — no build)

Grab **`wsldrive-setup.exe`** from the [latest release](https://github.com/zcsizmadia/wsldrive/releases/latest)
and run it. The wizard sets up Direction A by default; tick **Advanced** to also add Direction B. Each
release also ships `wsldrive-windows-x64.zip` (raw binaries + the install script) and `wsldrive-linux-x64`
(the Direction B client).

### 2. Run the script (no packaging — for CI, locked-down machines, or preference)

Download `wsldrive-windows-x64.zip` from the [latest release](https://github.com/zcsizmadia/wsldrive/releases/latest)
(or clone the repo), then from an **elevated** PowerShell:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\install.ps1   # interactive: Direction A (easy)
scripts\install.ps1 -Advanced        # also offer Direction B
scripts\install.ps1 -DryRun          # print the full plan, change nothing
scripts\install.ps1 -Unattended -DriveLetter W -Distro Ubuntu -WslRoot '~' -Yes          # Direction A
scripts\install.ps1 -Unattended -DriveLetter W -WinRoot C:\projects -Mountpoint '~/win' -Yes  # A + B
scripts\install.ps1 -Uninstall       # remove tasks + registration + binaries
```

### 3. Build the installer from source

```powershell
.\scripts\build.ps1                       # build wsldrive.exe / wsldrived.exe first
.\scripts\build-installer.ps1             # compile the wizard -> installer\dist\wsldrive-setup.exe
```

`build-installer.ps1` needs [Inno Setup](https://jrsoftware.org/isdl.php) (pass `-InstallInno` to fetch
it via winget). The GUI wizard is a thin front-end that drives `install.ps1`, so routes 1–3 all do
exactly the same thing. Releases (and their `wsldrive-setup.exe`) are produced automatically by the
`Release` workflow on each `v*` tag. To run wsldrive manually without installing, see [Usage](#usage).

## How it works

Two small user-space binaries, no kernel drivers of wsldrive's own:

- **`wsldrived`** — the *agent*: serves a directory tree (snapshot, file contents, writes) and watches
  it for changes (`ReadDirectoryChangesW`+IOCP on Windows, inotify on Linux), pushing coalesced
  invalidations.
- **`wsldrive`** — the *client*: mounts the served tree as a filesystem (WinFsp on Windows, libfuse3 in
  WSL, one FUSE3 implementation) backed by an in-RAM metadata mirror and a content cache.

Either binary can host either role, so the same code serves both directions — the direction is just
which side runs the agent and which runs the mount.

**Metadata in RAM.** The whole tree (names, sizes, mtimes, mode→attributes) loads on mount and stays
coherent via pushed invalidations, so `stat`/`readdir`/`open`/negative lookups never cross the boundary.

**Content cache + read-ahead.** Small files are cached whole in RAM (BLAKE3-addressed, LRU, invalidated
on change); on a read miss the file's directory is bulk-fetched in one `ReadMany` round-trip, so a
sequential reader pays one request per directory, not per file. On mount the client also **warms the
cache in the background** — it queues every directory whose small files fit the cache budget, so the
first reads a tool makes are already hot and cold-read latency is avoided (disable with `--no-prefetch`).

**Writes** are write-through by default (durability = the source filesystem); `--writeback` coalesces a
file's writes and flushes on `fsync`/close for write-heavy work.

### Transport

The wire protocol is a small framed binary protocol (24-byte little-endian header + payload) over a
stream socket. Two transports:

- **Hyper-V sockets** (`AF_HYPERV` on Windows, `AF_VSOCK` in WSL) — the fast path. WSL2 routes hvsocket
  host→guest, so the **WSL side listens** (`vsock://any:<port>`) and the **Windows side connects**
  (`hv://{<wsl-vm-guid>}:<port>`). Not IP, so no firewall involvement. This is what makes the
  WSL→Windows direction fast; see [Enabling hvsocket](#enabling-the-hyper-v-socket-transport).
- **Loopback TCP** — the fallback (works in NAT and mirrored WSL networking). Fast for Windows→WSL
  (Direction A); slow for the WSL→Windows request path, which is why Direction B wants hvsocket.

### Semantics (ext4 ↔ Windows)

| ext4 | Windows view |
|---|---|
| case-sensitive names | case-preserving; case-colliding siblings flagged, the shadowed one hidden |
| symlinks | reported as symlinks/reparse points |
| mode bits | synthesised attributes (`READONLY` when no write bit); no ACL emulation |
| ns mtime | truncated to 100 ns |
| hard links | reported as independent files (`st_nlink` not preserved) — known limitation |
| names illegal on Windows (`: ? * < > \| "`, control chars, trailing dot/space) | mapped to U+F0xx (WSL/Cygwin convention), round-tripping |
| sockets / fifos / devices | hidden |

A `.wsldriveignore` at the served root (gitignore-style: `node_modules/`, `*.log`, `/build`, …) excludes
paths from the mount and from sync.

**Non-goals:** replacing `/mnt/c` (wsldrive mounts alongside it); general-purpose bidirectional sync;
kernel drivers or signing beyond WinFsp's.

## Usage

### Direction A — mount a WSL ext4 tree as a Windows drive

Requires [WinFsp](https://winfsp.dev) (runtime **and** the Developer/SDK feature). From any PowerShell:

```powershell
wsldrive doctor                                            # check WinFsp + WSL
wsldrive mount W: --distro Ubuntu --wsl-root ~/project     # launches the agent in the distro, mounts W:
wsldrive mount W: --distro Ubuntu --wsl-root ~/project --hvsocket   # ... over Hyper-V sockets
```

`--distro` auto-launches `wsldrived` in the distro over `wsl.exe`, mounts, and tears it down on exit
(the agent self-terminates if the Windows side goes away). Ctrl+C unmounts cleanly. To attach to an
agent you started yourself: `wsldrive mount W: --connect tcp://127.0.0.1:7788`.

### Direction B — mount a Windows drive inside WSL

One command, run in WSL (launches the Windows agent via interop and mounts over hvsocket):

```bash
wsldrive mount /tmp/win --win-root 'C:/project' \
  --win-agent /mnt/c/path/to/wsldrived.exe --hvsocket
```

Or attach to an agent started on Windows yourself:

```bash
# on Windows:  wsldrived.exe --root C:\project --listen tcp://0.0.0.0:7788
# in WSL:      wsldrive mount /tmp/win --connect tcp://127.0.0.1:7788
```

### Enabling the Hyper-V socket transport

WSL2 only routes registered hvsocket services, so once per machine:

1. `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\register-hvsocket.ps1` **(elevated)** — registers
   the vsock service GUIDs (ports 5700–5709).
2. `wsl --shutdown` so the VM picks them up.
3. The WSL VM GUID is discovered automatically via `hcsdiag` (needs Hyper-V admin) or passed with
   `--vm-guid <guid>`.

## Benchmarks

Real-world cross-boundary numbers from `scripts/bench-real.ps1` on this dev machine (3000 small files
across 60 dirs; median warm run, ms; "native" = the same workload run locally on the owning OS — the
floor). Full methodology and notes in [`bench/RESULTS.md`](bench/RESULTS.md).

**Direction A — Windows reading a WSL2 ext4 tree:**

| scenario | walk (enumerate) | read (all bytes) |
|---|--:|--:|
| native (in WSL, reference) | 4 ms | 39 ms |
| `\\wsl.localhost` (Plan 9) | 104 ms | 2856 ms |
| **wsldrive drive** | **39 ms** | **cold 574 / warm 366 ms** |

**Direction B — WSL reading a Windows NTFS tree:**

| scenario | walk (enumerate) | read (all bytes) |
|---|--:|--:|
| native (on Windows, reference) | 10 ms | 118 ms |
| `/mnt/c` (9P) | 119 ms | 5853 ms |
| `/mnt/c` (virtiofs=true) | 406 ms | 7686 ms |
| **wsldrive over hvsocket** | **12 ms** | **cold 621 / warm 383 ms** |

So ~2.7× walk / ~5–8× read vs `\\wsl.localhost` (Direction A), and ~10× vs both `/mnt/c` transports
(Direction B) — with near-native metadata in both directions. Core micro-benchmarks (`core_bench`,
RelWithDebInfo):

| operation | time |
|---|---|
| path lookup, 3 components | ~150 ns |
| readdir, 100 entries | ~150 ns |
| (parent,name)→node probe, 1M entries, hit / miss | 15 ns / 14 ns (`std::unordered_map`: 44 ns) |
| snapshot encode / decode, 100k entries | 2.5 ms / 3.2 ms (36 bytes/entry) |
| coalesce 30k watcher events (10k-file checkout) | ~7 ms |
| BLAKE3 | 4.4 GiB/s |

Run them with `.\scripts\build.ps1 -Bench`, or the end-to-end suite with `.\scripts\bench-real.ps1`.

## Build

Modern C++23, CMake ≥ 3.28 + presets; dependencies (GoogleTest, Google Benchmark, BLAKE3) are fetched by
CMake with pinned hashes. Builds warning-clean under `/W4` (MSVC) and `-Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic
-Wconversion …` (GCC), warnings-as-errors including the linker.

Windows (Visual Studio 2022):

```powershell
.\scripts\build.ps1            # configure + build + unit tests (RelWithDebInfo)
.\scripts\build.ps1 -Bench     # ... and run the micro-benchmarks
```

WSL2 (Ubuntu 22.04+ / Debian 12+):

```bash
sudo ./scripts/wsl-setup.sh    # build-essential, cmake, ninja, libfuse3-dev
cmake --preset linux-release && cmake --build --preset linux-release && ctest --preset linux-release
```

The WinFsp mount builds only when WinFsp is detected (Windows); the libfuse3 mount only when libfuse3 is
detected (Linux) — so CI and minimal builds are unaffected.

## Layout

`src/core` — platform-independent library (metadata tree, string pool, framed protocol, coalescer,
content cache, ignore rules, name escaping, path utils), all unit-tested. `src/net` — sockets
(TCP/vsock/hvsocket) and the framed channel. `src/platform` — watchers and process launchers per OS.
`src/agent` — the scanner, `RootServer`, and the `RemoteRoot` client. `src/mount` — the FUSE3 mount.
`src/tools` — the `wsldrive` and `wsldrived` binaries. `tests`, `bench`, `scripts` as named.

## License

[MIT](LICENSE). WinFsp (a runtime dependency for Direction A) is licensed separately under GPLv3 or a
commercial license and is **not** bundled — the installer chain-installs it from winfsp.dev.
